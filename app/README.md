## About

Interview Scheduler is a full stack web application built with React, PostgreSQl and Node/Express. This application allows for users to create, manage and organize their interviews in an effort to help stream line the hiring process. Interview Scheduler also takes advantage of websockets in order to allow for the app to scale for larger buisnesses, allowing for real time changes to occur when multiple users are using the application.
